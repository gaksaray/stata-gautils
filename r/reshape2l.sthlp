{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:reshape2l} converts data from wide to long form.
It is primarily used in situations where {it:stubnames} are followed by numeric parts, which is often the case for raw panel datasets.

{pstd}
{cmd:reshape2l} is similar to {helpb reshape} {helpb reshape##overview:long} but significantly faster, especially for large (and wide) datasets where memory requirement gets very high and {cmd:reshape long} becomes very slow.
It achieves faster speeds by relying on secondary storage rather than memory.
The speed gain of {cmd:reshape2l} over {cmd:reshape long} increases with size and width of the dataset as well as read and write speed of storage device where the

{phang}
{opth i(varlist)} specifies the variables whose unique values denote a logical observation. {opt i()} is required.

{phang}
{opth j(varname)} specifies the variable whose unique values denote a numeric subobservation.

{phang}
{opt counter} prompts the program to display progress messages for the user.
