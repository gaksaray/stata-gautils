{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:svlog} is a wrapper for {help log}.
It opens a log file with the name _current_log, and saves it with the {it:script_name} and optionally (by default) a time and date stamp
to ./logs/ (or optionally {it:subdirectory}/logs/) folder.

{pstd}
{cmd:svlog close} closes the current log named _current_log.

{pstd}
{cmd:svlog clear} clears the /logs/ folder from the log files with names including {it:script_name}.
