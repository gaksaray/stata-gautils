d 'CLEARLAB': module to clear all labels and notes
d
d {cmd:clearlab} removes all variable labels, drops all value labels and detaches
d them from the variables, and drops all notes from the dataset and variables.
d It is especially useful when imported data has some of these characteristics
d that are not going to be used, and thus clean slate is preferred.
